# Lullaby for Austin

This lullaby was improvised by my son Olmo one evening when we were
trying to calm our latest addition to the family, Austin. He started
singing the first stanza: "Go to sleep my little darling... ahahhhh...".
It sounded nice, and my wife added some more words. I decided to make
an arrangement and publish it. So there it is!
